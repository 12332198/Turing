The knowledge for this AI comes from Wikipedia. However, as Wikipedia is unavailable in my area, I am unable to continue its training. 
It would be greatly appreciated if someone could complete its training and publicly release the model.
OK?
I have taken the initiative to prepare dual-language materials in both Chinese and English.
The Chinese-to-English and English-to-Chinese conversion encompasses the annotations, the primary content, 
and also covers the language in which the data was originally scraped.
My goal is for this to become functional and be put to use. Anyone with the requisite expertise is encouraged to take on this challenge.
Your efforts would be deeply appreciated.
